# LangSearch

The main goal of this project is to design and implement an online information retrieval (IR) system that uses efficient algorithms with the ability of the system to return a list of most relevant search results based on a user query, optimized for achieving the anticipated learning outcomes as opposed to generic relevance found in a general-purpose web search engine.
